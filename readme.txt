#Grades Project EDA & ML
#Take any Dataset of your choice, perform EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) and apply a suitable Classifier,Regressor or Clusterer and calculate the accuracy of the model.

This helped me to implement what I have learned from the course.
I have taken the grades dataset from Kaggle. Completed exploratory data analysis after normalising the data.
Since the dataset was too small, I enlarged the dataset to improve the accuracy.
I reshaped the x and y values since they were 1d arrays otherwise.
I used random forest classfier, random forest regressor and SVM models.
The accuracies I got in each case were 80.0, 76.92917188805347 and 80.0 .
